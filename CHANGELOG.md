# Changelog for Elixir v1.2

v1.2 brings enhancements, bug fixes, performance improvements and more
into Elixir. Elixir v1.2 relies on many features in Erlang 18, requiring
at least Erlang 18+. Upgrading to Erlang 18 is therefore necessary before
upgrading Elixir.

## Erlang 18 support

We have brought many features specific to Erlang 18. Here are the highlights:

  * Maps can now scale from dozens to millions of keys. Therefore, usage of
    the modules `Dict` and `HashDict` is now discouraged and will be
    deprecated in future releases, instead use `Map`. Similarly, `Set` and
    `HashSet` will be deprecated in favor of `MapSet`
  * Compilation times are faster due to improvements in both the Elixir and
    Erlang compilers
  * Dialyzer now emits less false negative warnings thanks to new annotations
    available in the Erlang compiler

## Language improvements

This release includes four notable language improvements:

  * The addition of multi aliases/imports/require:

        alias MyApp.{Foo, Bar, Baz}

  * Support for variables in map keys:

        %{key => value}

  * Support for the pin operator in map keys and function clauses:

        %{^key => value} = %{key => value}
        fn ^key -> :ok end

  * Addition of the `with` special form to match on multiple expressions:

        with {:ok, contents} <- File.read("my_file.ex"),
             {res, binding} <- Code.eval_string(contents),
             do: {:ok, res}

These improvements aim to make the language more consistent and expressive.

## Getting started experience

While we were improving the language, we also improved both the parser and
compiler to be even more aware of language constructs, emitting warnings
on common pitfalls like when piping to expressions without parentheses or
when defining unsafe variables.

We have also introduced the `i/1` helper in IEx, which allows developers
to retrieve information about any data type. This will help newcomers
explore the language values while providing experienced developers with
crucial information about the value they are introspecting.

## Workflow improvements

Umbrella applications are now able to share both build and configuration files.
This aims to drastically reduce compilation times in umbrella projects by
adding the following configuration to each umbrella app's `mix.exs` file:

    build_path: "../../_build",
    config_path: "../../config/config.exs",

Finally, Mix will now consolidate protocols by default as we are now able to
consolidate in parallel and cache the consolidation results, providing the
best performance across all environments without affecting compilation times.
The only downside of this change is that, if you have been implementing
protocols exclusively as part of your test suite, inside the `test` directory,
those won't be picked up as it happens after compilation. For such cases,
consolidation can be disabled by setting `consolidate_protocols: false` in
the project config.

These are great additions on top of the faster compilation times we have
achieved when migrating to Erlang 18.

## Rebar 3 support

With Rebar 3 gaining more adoption in the Erlang community, Mix is
now able to fetch and compile Rebar 3 dependencies. This feature is currently
experimental and therefore opt-in: if you have a Rebar 3 dependency, you can
ask Mix to use Rebar 3 to compile it by passing the `manager: :rebar3` option.
Once configured, Mix will prompt you to install Rebar 3 if it is not yet
available.
